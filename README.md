**[Open Source License Analysis Tool]**

The Open Source License Analysis Tool is designed to help developers, both novice and experienced, understand and comply with open source licenses. It analyzes the source code files in a given directory and generates a JSON report summarizing the licensing information.

Open source software is an essential component of modern software development. However, the complexity and variety of open source licenses can lead to unintentional violations. This tool aims to raise awareness and educate developers on the importance of license compliance, starting from their early development stages.

**Features**
- Analyzes source code files for licensing information
- Generates a detailed JSON report
- Supports multiple open source licenses
- Easy to integrate into development workflows

**Requirements**
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake
- curl library
- OpenAI API Key
